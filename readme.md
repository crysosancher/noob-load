The very first file is used to download any youtube video in 1080 quality,you just have insatll:-  
npm insatll  
npm i ytdl-core  
And then change the url link to your desired youtube video link(in the first file).  
Then run the script file:-  
node youtube.js   in your terminal/termux.  

where as the 2nd file youtube format is added for tweakers,who love to experiment,it gives the info/meta data of the url.
